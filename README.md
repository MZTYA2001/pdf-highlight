This GitHub repository hosts a Python-based program designed for advanced PDF processing and interaction. The program consists of two main components: PDFContextExtractor and PDFSearchAndDisplay. The PDFContextExtractor uses LangChain for contextual information retrieval from PDF documents, enhanced by AI capabilities from OpenAI's models. The PDFSearchAndDisplay class, leveraging PyMuPDF and pdfplumber, searches PDF documents for specific contexts, highlights them, and captures screenshots of pages with significant highlights. This tool is particularly useful for parsing and visually annotating PDFs based on context queries, suitable for academic research, document analysis, and automated report generation.
